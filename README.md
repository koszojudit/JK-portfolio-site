# JK-portfolio-site

This is my very first online portfolio webite, which has been created as a project of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Programme.

Live version here:
[https://koszojudit.github.io/](https://koszojudit.github.io/)

We were provided with a design mockup which we could customize and personalize, and make decisions in terms of the site's responsive behavior.

## What projects are included?

This site is a part of my professional portfolio, showing my coding skills.

## What projects are NOT included?

UX and UI design projects which I made for my employers.
Please contact me in person in case you are interested.

## Where to look into the code?

All projects are linked to GitHub repositories, and to my CodePen account where it is applicable.
You can have a look at the code there.
